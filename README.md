- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m PrzemysÅ‚aw Okun. I'm currently studying computer science in Gdynia.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and games. My most played games are League of Legends, Minecraft and CS:GO to name a few.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Java. I also made my own mobile game called "WLTBO" available in Google Play Store. It is my first game so nothing fancy.
